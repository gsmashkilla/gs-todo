# gs-todo

gs-todo is a repo containing documentation for interfacing with the enigmatic gsmashkilla

## Installation
gs-todo is made to allow others to request gsmashkilla to do stuff for them through an "interface".
It requires the user to have:
* an account on github
* an interesting idea
* and a lack of desire to pursue said idea themselves
* the reasone for the last point is that said user will forfeit all control over their project

## Interface
In order to insure your request gets met:
* follow the Fork and Pull [model](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
* remove all references to your ownership
* add some brief sketch of code to accompany your project

## Conclusion
Keep in mind that nothing is out of bounds and that gsmashkilla is architecture agnostic.
